# ToDoey

### Project description
This is a recreation of the iOS Reminders app. It was made for App Team Carolina's iOS Academy. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="todoey_adv.gif" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
</div>

The app replicates the look/feel of the iOS Reminders app. While not completely functional yet, it includes custom data types that would make expansion easier.

The simplicity of the design/code reflects the intention of this project: to educate students who are taking their first steps into iOS development.
